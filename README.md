# Fashion-Item-Classifier

# ðŸ‘— Fashion Item Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classifier built on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model identifies grayscale images of clothing items into one of 10 predefined categories.

## ðŸ§  Model Summary

*CNN Architecture*:
- Input: 28x28x1
- Conv2D (32 filters) + ReLU
- MaxPooling2D (2x2)
- Conv2D (64 filters) + ReLU
- MaxPooling2D (2x2)
- Flatten
- Dense (128 units) + ReLU
- Dense (10 units, Softmax)

*Compilation*:
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Metrics: Accuracy  
- Epochs: 10â€“20  
- Validation Split: 10%

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Test Accuracy: ~90â€“91% (may vary)
- Visualizations:
  - Accuracy/Loss curves
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Sample Predictions

The confusion matrix helps identify which classes are commonly confused (e.g., Shirt vs. T-shirt).
