# Fashion-Item-Classifier

# 👗 Fashion Item Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classifier built on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model identifies grayscale images of clothing items into one of 10 predefined categories.

## 📈 Results

- Test Accuracy: ~90–91% (may vary)
- Visualizations:
  - Accuracy/Loss curves
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Sample Predictions

The confusion matrix helps identify which classes are commonly confused (e.g., Shirt vs. T-shirt).
